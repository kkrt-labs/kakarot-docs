# K Stack - Introduce ZK to EVM Appchains

Kakarot can power appchains, we call it K Stack: an EVM-compatible ZK-appchain
stack. Every chain launched under this application will be provable in nature,
ensuring composability and interoperability with other chains. The portability
of Keth makes it embeddable in any appchain stack compatible or equivalent with
Ethereum. For instance: into the OP Stack or any new rollup stack based on EVM
and existing clients such as
[Reth Alphanet](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/alphanet).

We claim K Stack rivals those of competitors in both speed and cost, such as the
likes of ZKSyncâ€™s ZK Stack and Polygon CDK.

- **New EVM-equivalent ZK-appchains.** These protocols gain unbounded TPS with
  low running costs.

The K Stack is scheduled to go live in production by Q3 2025.
