# Kakarot on Bitcoin

Kakarot Keth can power Ethereum-compatible rollups on top of Bitcoin: the first
EVM proving engine verifiable on Bitcoin.

Currently, none of the existing Bitcoin scaling solutions have trust minimized
security assumptions. And with so many different L2s and rollups being
introduced on top of Bitcoin Layer 1, fragmentation of assets and liquidity will
pose issues to end users.

Soon Kakarot will be able to verify ZK-Proofs on Bitcoin. This is made possible
because OP_CAT (and a few other BIPs) would allow STARK proofs to also be
verified directly on Bitcoin. This would enable Bitcoin rollups to become
ZK-Rollups! Kakarot will therefore be able to help transition existing Bitcoin
EVM rollups into ZK-rollups, thus enabling self-custody and trust-minimization
for bridged BTC. This unlocks native DeFi and true rollups on Bitcoin,
unburdened by custodial bridges.
