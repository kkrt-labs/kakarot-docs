# K Stack - Introduce ZK to EVM Appchains

Kakarot can power appchains, we call it K Stack: an EVM-compatible ZK-appchain
stack. Every chain launched under this application will be provable in nature,
ensuring composability and interoperability with other chains.

We claim K Stack rivals those of competitors in both speed and cost, such as the
likes of ZKSyncâ€™s ZK Stack and Polygon CDK. There will be two flavors of K Stack
appchains:

- **Starknet MultiVM appchains, powered by Kakarot.** KKRT Labs will be working
  closely with trusted partners such as Starkware, Karnot and other appchain
  providers to deliver EVM-compatible Starknet appchains. These appchains will
  obtain MultiVM capabilities, allowing them to tap into bigger developer and
  user communities.
- **New EVM-equivalent ZK-appchains.** These protocols gain unbounded TPS with
  low running costs.

The first K Stack type is scheduled to go live in production by Q1 2025 while
the second K Stack type will be available by Q3 2025.
