## Glossary

- [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/) is an indexing protocol for organizing and
  accessing data from blockchains and storage networks. It allows developers to
  search, find, publish, and use the public data they need to build
  decentralized applications.
- [Protofire](https://protofire.io/) is a developers DAO that works with Web3
  projects, deliver solutions that bring growth in TVL and usage. Protofire have
  been in the ecosystem since 2016, working with more than 65 protocols and more
  than 25 networks. Protofire is one of the oldest and biggest indexers on The
  Graph Decentralized Network possessing significant knowledge base in the
  ecosystem.
- **Kakarot Hosted Service** is a service provided by Protofire on Kakarot
  network that allows anyone to deploy their Subgraphs over Kakarot.

## How to Deploy a Subgraph Using Kakarot Hosted Service

### Prerequisites

Before deploying the subgraph using the Kakarot Hosted Service, ensure that you
have installed the following:

- [Node.js and npm](#how-to-install-nodejs-and-npm)
- [Yarn](#how-to-install-yarn)
- [Graph CLI](#how-to-install-graph-cli)

### Step 1: Download the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/protofire/kakarot-subgraph
cd kakarot-subgraph
```

### Step 2: Build the Subgraph

```bash
yarn install
graph codegen
graph build
```

### Step 3: Get Credentials

You'll need credentials to use the Kakarot hosted service. Complete this form to
request permission to deploy a subgraph:

### Step 4: Deploy the Subgraph

Once you have your credentials (user and password), you can deploy the subgraph:

```bash
graph create --node https://user:password@index.kakarot.protofire.io kakarot/UniswapV2
graph deploy kakarot/UniswapV2 --version-label kakarot/UniswapV2 --headers "{\"Authorization\": \"Basic <user:password encoded>\"}" --ipfs https://ipfs.kakarot.protofire.io --node https://user:password@index.kakarot.protofire.io
```

Make sure to replace `user:password` with actual credentials received from
Protofire team, and `<user:password encoded>` with the same credentials, but
encoded in Base64. To encode your credentials you can use the following command:

```bash
echo user:password | base64
```

## Step 5: Verify subgraph status in Kakarot Subgraph Explorer

The link you receive in the output of the command in the step 4 will be
incorrect. To get the correct one - visit the
[Kakarot Subgraph Explorer](https://ui.kakarot.protofire.io/).
