Pimlico is a full-fledged account abstraction infrastructure platform that provides a set of advanced tools to help you build with smart accounts.

Account abstraction is a feature that allows users to customize their Ethereum accounts using smart contract logic. This unlocks new capabilities, such as multi-sig, social recovery, meta-transactions, batched transactions, and paying for transactions with ERC-20 tokens.

Pimlico offers a wide range of tools to help you get started on your smart account journey including:
- Bundler
- Paymaster
- Comprehensive metrics and analytics
- Advancement debugging / userOperation simulation
- Sponsorship policies
- Permissionless.js
