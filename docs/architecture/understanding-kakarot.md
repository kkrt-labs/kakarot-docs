## Kakarot, the zkEVM built in Cairo

Kakarot is a zkEVM built in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/), the provable language that powers [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/) and all the StarknetOS chains (also called CairoVM chains, or Starknet appchains). Kakarot is an Ethereum-compatible Layer 2, a [so-called zkRollup](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups). Beyond compatibility, Kakarot strives to push more innovations to the L2 space, and to add new features such as native account abstraction to the EVM. Kakarot's driving ethos is to _Prove, Scale and Innovate_ 🥕.

In concrete terms,
Kakarot is an Ethereum-compatible zk-Rollup:

- Ethereum-compatible: use the Kakarot and Ethereum in the same way.
- Zero-Knowledge (zk): minimized trust, maximized integrity derived from maths.
- Rollup: Enjoy lower costs than on Ethereum mainnet.

For users:

- For end users, use Kakarot ìn the same way as Ethereum mainnet: interact with dApps using any EVM wallet, e.g. Metamask or Rabby.
- For developers and teams, you can build on Kakarot using the Ethereum ecosystem's standard tools: Solidity or Vyper, Foundry, Hardhat, Etherjs etc.

Discover the Kakarot explorer and other useful links on the [survival guide](survival-guide) page.

Note: Kakarot is not a privacy chain. Zero-knowledge technologies can be used for two (non-excluding) purposes, Scaling or Privacy. Kakarot uses the former to scale Ethereum.

## How does Kakarot work under the hood?

### Kakarot is a set of Cairo programs that emulate the EVM

Under the hood, Kakarot zkEVM is a set of Cairo programs that implement the EVM instruction set. The EVM is the blueprint, Kakarot implements it in Cairo.

> Cairo is the first Turing-complete language for creating provable programs for general computation.

Cairo is essentially a high-level abstraction to write provable software. It is a "zk-toolbox". There is a "need": execute off-chain, verify on-chain. There is a requirement: respect the EVM blueprint. There is a tool: Cairo. There is an implementation: Kakarot.

Kakarot - the network - is composed of three parts: a set of Cairo programs (the Core EVM), an RPC layer (RPC server and EVM indexer) and an underlying CairoVM client (a StarknetOS chain).

### Kakarot relies on an underlying (invisible) StarknetOS client

The Kakarot core EVM, i.e. the set of Cairo programs that implement the EVM, are deployed on an underlying StarknetOS chain. This means that Kakarot is running as a set of Cairo smart contracts on a CairoVM-powered chain. Nevertheless, this CairoVM chain is "invisible" to the user. Users only interact with Kakarot through the RPC layer in an Ethereum-compatible way. The only exposed interface in Kakarot zkEVM is the Ethereum JSON-RPC specification.

To put it simply, Kakarot L2 is composed of a set of Cairo programs that emulate the EVM and an RPC layer to allow users to interact with it in an Ethereum format. All Cairo execution traces are provable by design, which allows Kakarot to batch blocks and submit proofs to L1 using the [Starkware Shared prover](https://starkware.co/tech-stack/) (SHARP). Because Cairo is a vibrant ecosystem, other prover implementations in the future will emerge, such as Lambdaclass' [Stark Platinum Prover](https://github.com/lambdaclass/lambdaworks/tree/main/provers). This will enable multi-proof security and increase robustness of the Kakarot network.

In Kakarot zkEVM, the design choices EVM programs and their Cairo equivalents are explained below. They are subject to architecture changes over time. **🎙️ Disclaimer 🎙️: all these designs choices are invisible to the user**:

- each EVM smart contract (so-called _Contract Account_) is deployed as a unique Starknet smart contract. This Starknet smart contract stores its own bytecode and EVM storage slots.
- each EVM user-owned account (so-called _Externally Owned Account (EOA)_) is deployed as a Starknet smart contract wallet.
  - It has a Starknet formatted address (31 bytes hex string), which is uniquely mapped to the user EOA EVM address (20 bytes hex string). For the user, this is invisible.
  - Its native balance in ETH (coin vs. token) is denominated in ERC20 native token under the hood in the Kakarot system. For the user, this is invisible.
  - It behaves exactly like an EOA, uses the same signature and validation scheme as Ethereum mainnet, though it can be extended in the future to support innovative features!
- EVM transactions that are sent by users are wrapped in Starknet transactions. The derived EVM Transaction hashes are mapped 1-to-1 with underlying Starknet transaction hashes. Since signature verification is done in a Cairo program, transactions are provably processed with integrity [despite being wrapped at the RPC level](https://github.com/kkrt-labs/kakarot-rpc/blob/bcadfc9b38ac934f73832b3a3485c15f08d66218/src/eth_rpc/servers/eth_rpc.rs#L236). For the user, this is invisible.
- new state roots are computed using Pedersen hash and not keccak because of the zk-unfriendliness of keccak. This does not hurt EVM compatibility at the applicative level.
- the state trie is computed using Pedersen MPT and not [Keccak MPT](https://ethereum.org/developers/docs/data-structures-and-encoding/patricia-merkle-trie). Note that the transaction trie and receipt trie are both computed as keccak MPTs, for block explorers, but as pedersen MPTs for the proof commitment.

TL;DR - whatever is written in Cairo can be proven. Kakarot implements the EVM specification, in Cairo. It is provable by design. All the Cairo magic is done under the hood. For the user, this is invisible. They are interacting with an EVM chain.

## The difference between Kakarot and other zkEVMs

Kakarot zkEVM is probably the most high-level zkEVM. On the scale of maths language and polynomials to human understandable language, Kakarot is closer to human readable language than any other zkEVM. This matters to users in two ways:

- Because Kakarot is built on Cairo, Kakarot as a codebase is extremely slim (an order of magnitude lighter than other zkEVMs) and thus extremely easy to maintain, adapt to Ethereum changes, or add new features to (e.g. native account abstraction).
- Cairo (through Starknet) is a vibrant ecosystem and Kakarot can benefit from all its innovations with ease (same underlying tech stack). Ideas on the long term could include parallel execution, seed-less wallets (e.g. rely on face ID only), Celestia DA integration and more.

TL;DR - By betting on the CairoVM for the years to come, Kakarot synergizes with the entire Cairo (and thus Starknet) ecosystem. Cairo is the most advanced high-level zk-toolbox in production, first with [StarkEx](https://www.theblock.co/post/237064/starkex-layer-2-records-1-trillion-in-on-chain-trading-volume-since-june-2020) and now Starknet.

We believe that in focusing only on engineering, our approach is scalable and sustainable.
