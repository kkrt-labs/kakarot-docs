## What is Kakarot on Starknet?

Kakarot Labs has developed an EVM built in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/),
the provable language that powers [Starknet](https://starkware.co/starknet/) and
all the StarknetOS chains (also called CairoVM chains, or Starknet appchains).

Kakarot enhances and extends Starknet by making it a MultiVM environment.
Starknet effectively becomes EVM compatible; allowing the use of both CairoVM
and EVM for builders & users. Additionally, Kakarot
[strives to push more innovations](https://ethcc.io/archive/Kakarot-zkEVM-beyond-ethereum-compatibility)
to the L2 space, participating in governance initiative such as
[Rollup Improvement Proposals](https://github.com/ethereum/RIPs) (RIPs) and
[Rollcall](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1071#issuecomment-2221171582).

## How can I use Kakarot?

As a user and developer, you can interact with Starknet MultiVM thanks to
Kakarot in the same way you would interact with Ethereum mainnet or any other
Ethereum-based chain (use Metamask, Rainbow, build with Foundry or Hardhat,
etc.). **Change the RPC URL and it "just works"**. That being said, Kakarot is
still in alpha testnet phase 🚧 and unexpected behavior may still occur. Reach
out to us on [discord](https://discord.gg/kakarotzkevm) to report bugs 🐛.

Though we aim at no difference at all between Ethereum and Kakarot ZK-EVM — and
we actually work toward passing 100% of the
[official Ethereum Foundation test](https://github.com/ethereum/tests) — they
are currently some small difference recorded in the
[differences between Kakarot and Ethereum](differences) page in this
documentation website.

### As a user, how can I interact with Kakarot on Starknet?

Head over to the [survival guide](survival-guide) section to find useful links
for our alpha testnet. Again, change the network to Kakarot in your wallet and
it should "just work".

#### Adding Kakarot Sepolia to Metamask

You can add Kakarot Sepolia to Metamask by clicking the button below:

export const AddKakarotNetwork = () => (
  <button
    onClick={async () => {
      const params = [
        {
          chainId: "0x6B6B7274",
          chainName: "Kakarot Sepolia",
          nativeCurrency: {
            name: "Ether",
            symbol: "ETH",
            decimals: 18,
          },
          rpcUrls: ["https://sepolia-rpc.kakarot.org"],
          blockExplorerUrls: [
            "https://sepolia.kakarotscan.org/",
            "https://sepolia-blockscout.kakarot.org",
          ],
        },
      ];
      try {
        // Note: if chain is already added, returns `null` and won't error out
        await window.ethereum.request({
          method: "wallet_addEthereumChain",
          params,
        });
      } catch (error) {
        // TODO: Add User feedback (e.g. Toast message) in case of error
        console.error(error);
      }
    }}
    className="button button--primary button--md padding-horiz--md padding-vert--md margin--md margin-bottom--lg"
  >
    🦊 Add Kakarot Sepolia to Metamask 🦊
  </button>
);

<AddKakarotNetwork />

Or by add a new network manually to Metamask: open the Metamask extension. Click
"Add Network". Choose "Add a Network Manually". Then fill the fields:

| Category       | Value                            |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Network Name   | Kakarot Sepolia                  |
| RPC URL        | https://sepolia-rpc.kakarot.org  |
| Chain Id       | 1802203764                       |
| Symbol         | ETH                              |
| Block Explorer | https://sepolia.kakarotscan.org/ |

### As a developer, how can I build on Kakarot ZK-EVM?

For developers as well, change the RPC URL, and it should "just work".

## What differentiates Kakarot on Starknet?

1. Agile and lightweight: Kakarot's core EVM is built on Cairo, a provable VM,
   enabling cryptography efforts to be separated from engineering. As a result,
   Kakarot's code is lean, highly auditable and easily extensible. A strong
   example is the
   [EOF set of Ethereum Improvement Proposals probably coming in Pectra](https://x.com/_weidai/status/1816019532890444216),
   which are easy to implement for Kakarot and extremely hard for circuit-based
   ZK-EVMs.

2. Interoperable and modular: Kakarot enables a MultiVM environment on Starknet
   chains. Solidity contracts can call into Cairo programs, and vice-versa.
   Starknet apps can gain exposure to EVM ecosystems, and EVM apps can finally
   land on Starknet for minimal costs.

3. Highly-performant and future-proof: Building on Kakarot means benefiting from
   all the future upgrades of the Cairo stack. For instance, with the release of
   [Stwo](https://github.com/starkware-libs/stwo), an extremely fast prover by
   Starkware expected in early 2025, Kakarot apps will directly experience
   100-1,000x improvements in ZK proof generation performance.
