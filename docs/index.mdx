## Welcome to our documentation v3

Welcome to our new documentation! We've updated it to reflect our roadmap and
vision for the coming years: proving the Ethereum Protocol in real-time. Kakarot
is an EVM proof generation engine, and we are bringing it to all
Ethereum-equivalent chains: L1, rollups and Bitcoin sidechains.

## Introduction

KKRT Labs is building Kakarot, a state-of-the-art lightweight and efficient
ZK-EVM proving engine. Proving the Ethereum execution layer and consensus layer
unlocks the ability to
["SNARKify" Ethereum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRqnFrqpq4k), scaling it
to a capacity comparable to Visa. Kakarot is built on Cairo, Starkwareâ€™s
STARK-friendly ZK-VM.

We strongly believe that networks will benefit from transitioning to ZK, both in
security and performance. This starts by generating ZK-proofs of block
execution.
