### DipDup

[DipDup](https://dipdup.io/) is a Python framework for building smart contract
indexers. It helps developers focus on business logic instead of writing a
boilerplate to store and serve data. DipDup-based indexers are selective, which
means only required data is requested. This approach allows to achieve faster
indexing times and decreased load on underlying APIs.
